1. Paradigm
C:

Procedural programming language.
Focuses on functions and the sequence of actions to be performed.
C++:

Multi-paradigm language (supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming).
Emphasizes the concept of objects, which can encapsulate both data and functions.
2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
C:

Does not support object-oriented programming directly.
Lacks features such as classes and inheritance.
C++:

Fully supports object-oriented programming.
Introduces classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
3. Data Abstraction
C:

Uses structures (struct) to group related data but does not support encapsulation.
C++:

Uses classes to encapsulate data and functions, providing better data abstraction and protection.
4. Function Overloading
C:

Does not support function overloading (multiple functions with the same name but different parameters).
C++:

Supports function overloading, allowing multiple functions with the same name as long as their parameter lists are different.
5. Operator Overloading
C:

Does not support operator overloading.
C++:

Allows operators (like +, -, *) to be redefined for user-defined types, enabling intuitive syntax.
6. Standard Library
C:

The standard library (C Standard Library) primarily consists of functions for handling input/output, string manipulation, and memory management.
C++:

Includes the C Standard Library and the C++ Standard Library, which features extensive data structures (like vectors, lists, maps) and algorithms (STL - Standard Template Library).
7. Memory Management
C:

Manual memory management using malloc(), calloc(), realloc(), and free().
C++:

Provides dynamic memory management using new and delete operators, making it easier to allocate and deallocate memory for objects.
8. Namespaces
C:

Does not support namespaces. All identifiers must be unique, which can lead to name conflicts in larger programs.
C++:

Introduces namespaces to avoid naming conflicts and organize code.
9. Exception Handling
C:

Does not have built-in support for exception handling. Error handling is typically done through return codes.
C++:

Supports exception handling using try, catch, and throw, allowing for more robust error handling.
10. Compatibility
C:

C programs can usually be compiled with a C++ compiler, but C++ programs cannot be compiled with a C compiler due to features like classes.
C++:

Designed to be compatible with C; most valid C code is valid C++ code.
11. Template Programming
C:

Does not support templates.
C++:

Supports template programming, allowing the creation of generic functions and classes that can operate with any data type.
12. Use Cases
C:

Preferred for system programming, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications where low-level hardware interaction is required.
C++:

Commonly used for application software, game development, graphical applications, and systems where OOP is beneficial.

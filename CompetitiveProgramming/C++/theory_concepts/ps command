Difference bw ps -ax and ps -aef

The commands ps -ax and ps -aef both list processes, but they display different information and use slightly different options.

ps -ax:

The -a option shows processes associated with all terminals, not just the current one.
The -x option includes processes that do not have a controlling terminal (like background services and daemons).

Output includes only essential details like the process ID (PID), TTY, time, and command.
ps -aef:

The -a option similarly shows all users' processes.
The -e option displays all processes (like -a and -x together, so all processes with and without a terminal).
The -f option displays a full format listing, which includes more details like the user, PID, parent PID (PPID), start time, and the full command with arguments.
Key Differences:

ps -ax provides a simpler, more minimal output (without additional details like user or PPID).
ps -aef gives a detailed view with more process metadata (such as user, PPID, and full command).


Here are example commands with their respective outputs:

ps -ax:

ps -ax
Example output:


 PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
    1 ?        Ss     0:01 /sbin/init
  839 ?        Sl     0:00 /usr/bin/gnome-shell
 1324 ?        Ss     0:00 /usr/lib/systemd/systemd --user
 1452 ?        Ss     0:00 /usr/bin/ssh-agent -s
This output shows:

PID: Process ID.
TTY: Terminal associated with the process.
STAT: Process state.
TIME: Amount of CPU time used.
COMMAND: The name of the command or program being run.
ps -aef:
bash
Copy code
ps -aef
Example output:

sql

UID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
root         1     0  0 08:00 ?        00:00:01 /sbin/init
user      839   825  0 08:00 ?        00:00:00 /usr/bin/gnome-shell
user     1324  1322  0 08:00 ?        00:00:00 /usr/lib/systemd/systemd --user
user     1452  1430  0 08:02 ?        00:00:00 /usr/bin/ssh-agent -s

This output includes more details:

UID: The user running the process.
PID: Process ID.
PPID: Parent Process ID (the process that spawned this one).
C: CPU utilization percentage.
STIME: Start time of the process.
TTY: Terminal associated with the process.
TIME: Amount of CPU time used.
CMD: The command and arguments that started the process.
As you can see, ps -aef provides more information than ps -ax.
